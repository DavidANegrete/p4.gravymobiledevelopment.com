 This application is to be used by nail salon clients to pick a service and extras and lastly book an appointment. The framework is the same one that we used for our p2, projects. The application is meant to be used by the administrator the appointments by means of the appointments database.
 	The application uses JavaScript to help a user select an appointment. JQuery is also used as a plugin to check if the forms that are being submitted or valid. I used AJAX to validate and submit the form that is used to delete an account.
 	***Features***
 *Delete Account
 *View next appointment
 *Sign up for an appointment.
